This shinyapp is in Italian because it was requested to me by my Italian boardgame society "Giochi in Circolo" https://giochi-in-circolo.it/

It is now hosted at circoloshiny dot shinyapps dot io slash shinycircolo

It does two things:
1) Asks for a list of names (nomi)  and a list of sizes (dimensione tavolo)
2) randomises the names across different tables. It is used to generate random assignments for tournaments.
