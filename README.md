# Shinyapps
This github contains a number of small (few hundred lines) shinyapps in R to do cool visualisation. The main theme behind this is epidemic modelling. Some of these apps were produced with assistance of LLMs. No app is entirely made from a LLM prompt (no vibe coding here), but some handy but boring to code functions were created and tested using LLMs.

Each subfolder contains one code (app.R) and a readme file that explains what the code does. Feel free to download/use/modify/reproduce anything, as these are just little side projects made for fun.
